SEI Emergency Compliment, in Express
Missionâ€¦
Create your own version of Emergency Compliment, using Express. When a user visits the site, they should be 

greeted with a WDI-themed compliment to cheer them up.

Level 1: generic compliment
When you visit the root ("/") path of your app, 

it should display a generic greeting and a randomly chosen compliment. 
The background color of the app should be randomized as well. Use server side technology (not client side js) to set the background color.

Here are some sample compliments and colors (feel free to substitute in your own):

compliments = [
  "Your instructors love you",
  "High five = ^5",
  "Shut up and take my money",
  "It's almost beer o'clock",
  "The Force is strong with you"
]

colors = ["#FFBF00", "#0080FF","#01DF3A","#FF0080"]
You may want to use the underscore or lodash module on the server to help you pick a random compliment & color

Level 2: personalized compliment
When you visit "/name" (ie: "/randy"), the greeting should personalize itself to the provided name. There should still be a random compliment and background color
